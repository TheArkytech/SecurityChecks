# Security System Auto-Improvement

> This file is a living log of suggestions to improve the security system
> itself (prompts, KB, checks, coverage). Prompts A and B write suggestions
> here. Guillermo reviews and approves them on Fridays.

## How it works

1. **Prompt A (Radar)** — After each daily scan, evaluates if the security
   system has gaps and logs suggestions here
2. **Prompt B (Auditor)** — After each audit, evaluates if the audit
   checklists need improvements and logs suggestions here
3. **Friday** — Guillermo reviews suggestions, approves the ones that make
   sense, and implements them (or asks Claude to implement them)

## Suggestion categories

- **PROMPT** — Improvements to the prompts (new research areas, better format, etc.)
- **KB** — New sections or fields for the Knowledge Base
- **CHECK** — New checks to add to Prompt B (auditor)
- **COVERAGE** — Security areas not currently covered
- **PROCESS** — Process or cadence improvements
- **TOOLING** — Tools or integrations to consider

<!-- Format:
### [YYYY-MM-DD] [CATEGORY] Short title
- **Origin:** Prompt A / Prompt B / Manual
- **Description:** What to improve and why
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low
- **Effort:** High / Medium / Low
-->

### [2026-04-03] [CHECK] Add MCP server security audit to Prompt B
- **Origin:** Prompt A
- **Description:** The MCP ecosystem has 30+ CVEs in 60 days, with 82% of implementations vulnerable to path traversal. Prompt B's audit checklist (AGENTS.md rule #11) only says "review periodically." We should add a concrete MCP audit section to Prompt B that checks: server versions against CVE database, token scopes, whether servers use HTTPS, and input validation patterns.
- **Impact:** High
- **Effort:** Low

### [2026-04-03] [PROMPT] Add Claude Code configuration audit to Prompt A
- **Origin:** Prompt A
- **Description:** The Claude Code source leak revealed configuration injection attacks (CVE-2026-21852) via malicious `.claude/` and `.claudecode/` files in repos. Prompt A should include a check for newly disclosed Claude Code / AI tool CVEs and advise on configuration file hygiene.
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Effort:** Low

### [2026-04-03] [COVERAGE] Track GitHub Actions SHA pinning status
- **Origin:** Prompt A
- **Description:** TeamPCP's campaign exploited mutable GitHub Action tags to inject malicious code. We should track which of our projects have SHA-pinned Actions vs mutable tags, and flag any regressions. This could be a new section in the KB or a check in Prompt B.
- **Impact:** High
- **Effort:** Medium

## Instructions for prompts

### For Prompt A (add at the end of each execution):
After completing the daily report, reflect briefly:
- Was there any security area you couldn't cover well? Why?
- Was the report format adequate or could something improve?
- Are there information sources you should check but aren't in your instructions?
- Does the Knowledge Base have the right structure for what you found today?

If you identify something, add an entry to the "Pending suggestions" section
of `docs/SELF-IMPROVEMENT.md`.

### For Prompt B (add at the end of each execution):
After completing the audit, reflect briefly:
- Were there vulnerabilities you looked for but your checklist didn't cover?
- Is any checklist category outdated or incomplete?
- Does the scorecard accurately reflect the project's security posture?
- Do you need access to tools or data you don't have?

If you identify something, add an entry to the "Pending suggestions" section
of `docs/SELF-IMPROVEMENT.md`.
